Recently I've been learning about Reinforcement learning and it's 
applications in the field of control, mechatronics and gaming. 

It's super fascinating to see how AI learns to play games. My ultimate 
project is to train a deep reinforcement decision making Chess AI which 
definitely isn't easy.

This project is just a fun project where I push myslef to learn stuffs. 
Currently I've been working on neural CHESS ENGINES and neural TIC TAC TOE 
engine. 

This project aims to serve just some fun. I've used QDN to train my model 
which plays the game of Chrome Dinosaur. The model has been trained on a 
small dataset cause, Oh Please! I'm broke, I don't have a high-end GPU and 
colab crashes when the data is large and the model is complex. 

So the batch sizes are small to serve quick training. 

The model works fine enough. I achieved a total score of 300 after training it for about 40 minutes.
